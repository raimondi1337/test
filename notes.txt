Performance
We're querying to get restaurants by time, so it would be more performant to store the restaurants in 30 minute buckets and just request that entry
Obviously this would be in some type of database in a real environment not a CSV. I typically use Postgres if there isn't a need to use something fancy.

Ingestion/fragility
The regex ingestion is very fragile and will break if a new format is added to the list.
Assuming we control the source, the solution here is to enforce clean data coming in at the beginning of the pipeline (ie require minutes).
If we don't control the source and the formats are anticipated to change, the regex solution would need to be made much more robust.

Testing
Unit tests should exist on basically all of the python
Integration tests for the API for a variety of cases that segment the existing data source into sensible groups;
weekday noon, weekend night, morning, after hours, old dates, future dates, etc.

Stdlib
A bunch of what I've written here would have been much more robust and maintainable using libraries like Flask, requests, etc
Usually prefer to use the most popular tools/solutions to build things that actually need to ship, until there's a good reason to make something from scratch or use something niche
